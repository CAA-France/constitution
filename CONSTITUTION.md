    1. The speakers will be elected biennially at the CAA - FR General Meeting.
    1. One of the speakers of CAA - FR will be designated, by the speakers, as the representative of the national chapter to CAA International (this ex-oficio member of the CAA International Steering Committee must be a member of CAA International; https://caa-international.org/constitution/ [article 4.iv]).
    1. Speakers may resign by sending notice to the remaining speakers or to all members of CAA - FR through the current mailing list.

        * an existing conference, or 
        * any other compatible conferences which will further the aims of CAA - FR and its members.
    1. To maintain a web portal with relevant information from the various networks covering the fields of the CAA.
